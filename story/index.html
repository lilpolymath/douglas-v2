    <section>
      <p>
        My name is Douglas Franklin, my friends call me DF. I’m a Nigerian (he/him) living in Lagos, Nigeria. Throughout
        my Life, I have used software to express myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently building the future of addressing at <a href="https://www.okhi.com/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">OkHi</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, I built software to help local businesses run subscriptions at <a href="https://www.tryperdiem.com/"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TryPerDiem(YCombinator
          W21)</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Per Diem, I worked on the growth team at <a href="https://ouredenlife.com/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">EdenLife</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before EdenLife, I worked for a few companies in the German ecosystem and got my hands dirty.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my previous life, I graduated with a degree in Pure Mathematics and worked in the Oil and Gas industry for a
        few years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working in Tech is one of the most impactful and important life choices I’ve made and I’m forever grateful for
        the
        experience I have had.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m particularly interested in Product Management, technology as a progress tool, and how we shape our world
        through products.
      </p>

      <p>
        I write and speak about what I am passionate about, and I always love chatting about products and product
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm following interests in topics of technology, contemporary art, progress studies, economics, and the future:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Studying the intersection of technology, economics, and human progress.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborating with friends on new software for creators.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I've worked with excellent teams and clients during the past years based in Dubai, New York, San Francisco, and
        Bangalore.
